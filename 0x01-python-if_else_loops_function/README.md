# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project involves basic Python programming concepts, including control flow, loops, and functions. The exercises help in understanding the fundamental aspects of Python programming.

## Tasks

1. **Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
   - Assign a random signed number to a variable and print whether it's positive, negative, or zero.

2. **The last digit**
   - Print the last digit of a random signed number and state whether it is greater than 5, equal to 0, or less than 6 but not 0.

3. **I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
   - Print the ASCII alphabet in lowercase without a new line.

4. **When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
   - Print the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.

5. **Hexadecimal printing**
   - Print numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal format.

6. **00...99**
   - Print numbers from 0 to 99, formatted as two digits, separated by a comma and a space.

7. **Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**
   - Print all possible different combinations of two digits.

8. **islower**
   - Write a function to check if a character is lowercase.

9. **To uppercase**
   - Write a function that prints a string in uppercase.

10. **There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important**
    - Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

11. **a + b**
    - Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

12. **a ^ b**
    - Write a function that computes `a` to the power of `b` and returns the result.

13. **Fizz Buzz**
    - Write a function that prints numbers from 1 to 100, substituting "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.
